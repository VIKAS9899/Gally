# Usage

*For a working implementation, please have a look at the Sample Project - sample*

1. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

	```
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
	```
2. Add the dependency
```
dependencies {
		implementation 'com.github.VIKAS9899:Gally:1.0'
	}
```
3. Add MediaStoreActivity into your AndroidManifest.xml

    ```
    <activity android:name="com.vikas.gally.activity.MediaStoreActivity"
            android:screenOrientation="portrait"/>
    ```
5. sdcard Read,Write Permission into AndroidManifest.xml
    ```
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
    ```

4. The Gally configuration is created using the builder pattern.

    ```java
    Decorator decorator = new Decorator.Builder()
                .setMaxSelection(7)
                .setTitle("GallySample")
                .setTickColor(R.color.colorAccent)
                .build();
    ```

5. Override `onActivityResult` method and handle result.

    ```java
    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, @Nullable Intent data) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
        if (requestCode == MediaStoreActivity.REQUEST_CODE_LAUNCH && resultCode == RESULT_OK) {

            ArrayList<String> selectedPath = data.getStringArrayListExtra(MediaStoreActivity.EXTRA_IMAGE_PATHS);
            System.out.println(selectedPath);
            //do Anything with the selected images
        }
    }
    ```
